# Ruislip Islands 

## 02.05 Dunrick

This small isle is thick with hypertrophied vegetable growth. The plants lean eagerly towards Ruislip, leaves extended like fingers. 

Those sleeping here are strangled in the night by the plants, loving coils around necks. In the years to come, they awake as if from a dream, skin of bark, legs all root and leaves fat and green. 

## 05.05 Shoal

An inhospitable spit of land rearing up from the ocean. Rocks jut like spears. Clambering to the top without tools is likely to result in death upon the rocks.

At the top is the Griffon nest. Five chicks squawk hungrily. They each have 1HD. Killing them will drive the Griffon to rampage across Ruislip, seeking the murderers.

There is a 20% chance it is in it's lair - otherwise returning on a 2-in-6 per Turn. It will be seen coming 1 Turn away, unless weather is poor. 

## Isle of Kindee

### 01.16 Burnt Village 

Devastation marks this area. Lifeless blackened ruins, consumed utterly by flame. Gouges as deep as plough-lines in the remaining stone - as if something terrible dug here. No bodies, no bones, no life. Just devastation, untouched by the years. 

### 02.16 Lair of Sruthkin

A huge dome of earth, grass and shrubs grown atop it. Breathing can be heard within - the slumber of Sruthkin, a Dragon. Atop the hoard of his slain raider kin he dreams, scales iron and bronze. If anyone carrying more than 200sp enters, he will awaken. Otherwise, only violence or disturbing the hoard will awaken him.

The hoard is magnificent (Monstrous V):

- 17000sp in heaped coins of all origins and denominations.
- 10 gold ingots, worth 2000sp
- 20 silver ingots, worth 1000sp
- 10 suits of Full Length Maille, worth 1500sp.
- _The Water Bell._ (&T)
- A _Whale's Eye._ (&T)
- The _Armwolf._ (&T)
- _Oathchain._ (&T)

\newpage

# Ruislip

### 03.07 Ogre House 

A drystone house, chaotically expanded and repaired into a near labyrinth, hides between two low hills. Heaps of bones, driftwood, and flowers are all around it. Within can be heard heavy footsteps and a low, continuous monologue. The words are indistinct. An Ogre dwells within. He wishes to possess all bones - flaccid carcasses are strewn within. Rats sneak into his bone-hoard at night. This enrages him. He is attuned to all sounds in the house, and stalks intruders cautiously.

There is a 80% chance they are here - otherwise returning on a 3-in-6 per Turn spent exploring, an animal or human trapped in their sack, screaming.

The bone-hoard is within a sack he carries. In addition to the thousands of bones (Monstrous II): 

- 400sp in rough, local silver coins.
- 200sp in cowry shells.
- 240sp in wolf pelts, stained and degraded with rot.
- 360sp in golden thread.
- A rough map, pricked onto goatskin. It shows a street within Donenashoe. Beneath the flagstones is hidden treasure (Monstrous III):
	+ 600sp in mixed coinage.
	+ 150 _Silver Tetradrachms_ (&T).
	+ 300sp worth of ritual incenses.
	+ A _Pearl Eye._ (&T)
	+ A vial of _Inverse Varnish._ (&T)
	+ _Nastroph_, in a small stone case. (&T)

### 04.07 Beached Whale 

Upon the sands, a beached killer whale slowly dies. It snaps at those approaching like a feral dog. In it's stomach, 1d100 fish in various states of decomposition, a statue of an angry sea god and a clam with a pearl worth 100sp.

### 01.08 Runestones 

A pair of stones, each with inscriptions. The first is in Norse, and reads "Hwrulf threw this stone from the hill behind which the sun sets. Before that, he slew a barbarian chief.".  
The second is in Ghom, and reads "Let not this marker dub us property of the sea men but only act as a gravestone.". The second runestone is noticeably bigger. 

\newpage

### 02.08 Stamullen

Hidden amongst the deeper trees, the village of Stamullen can be smelt before it is heard, and heard before it is seen. Honey bees fill the air - multiple large colonies swell amongst the proliferation of wildflowers. They seem docile and loathe to sting. 79 people live here, well fed and clothed with their honey-wealth. 

They all owe this to Macullen, one of the newest Druids. Against the orders of the Druid-Cult, he has tamed the bees. He does not know they will destroy him and make his ribcage the foundation for a new nest. The village will die as the bees return to defending their nests. This will happen in 1d6 weeks - preceded by fen wolves raiding the nests. The Druid-Cult will only dispatch one member of their order to perform the killing. If Macullen survives, they will accept his judgement and leave the village bee. 

15 skirmishers, 12 bee-swarms.


### 04.08 Culemwardern

Atop a hillock, a town of 600 squats behind a wooden palisade, spikes bristling against all comers. The wide, slow river flows past them and towards the sea. Their fishing vessels make the journey daily, although they watch the sky fearfully. 

They are ruled by Cioran (4HD, Full Length Maille, Two-Handed Axe), who owes loyalty to no man nor god. His Rival, Forgall, claims his grandfather sailed from Albann. The people clamour for Cioran to slay the Griffon which attacks their fishing vessels. He does not want to leave Culemwardern - he fears death by the Griffon and Forgall securing the town against him. He offers 1200sp in jewellery and coins for the head of the Griffon.

Forgall believe the inhabitants of Cloyne are behind the Griffon attacks. He and Cioran agree that the influence of the Druids is to be opposed. 

40 footmen, 50 skirmishers, two Karvi equivalent ships plus 8 fishing boats.

### 05.08 Cloyne

58 live within this loose accumulation of hovels. Cattle and swine are attended to by children whilst the parents fish upon the sea. They watch the North carefully - their waters have been appropriated by Culemwardern before.  The Griffon does not attack their vessels - those of Culemwardern are closer and more laden with fish.

Nominally they are ruled by Beyf (2HD, Maille, Sword & Shield) but most affairs fall to the Druid in 06.09. Few of the villagers have seen them directly - the druid speaks in broken twigs, whorls of blood and burst earth. Those most able to interpret these signs are expected to be called to join that secretive order. The populace is fanatically loyal to the Druid-Cult - most (80%) would die willingly for them.

19 skirmishers, 5 fishing boats. 

### 01.09 Manticore Cave

The cliffs above the stony beach are wounded by sea-caves, accessible on foot whilst the tide is out. Echoes of water move strangely in this chaotic geology. A Manticore stalks the caves, wearing a stolen face. It allows itself to be seen but does not engage in combat - it wants the Faceless Man to hire ever-more expensive mercenaries. Stealing his face was not enough - it wants to ruin his fortunes. It attempts to toy with intruders until the tide comes back in, drowning them.

There is a 50% chance it is in it's lair - otherwise returning on a 2-in-6 per Turn spent exploring.

The deeper, higher, dryer caves serve as a den - this is where it eats and dreams of revenge. It has destroyed a holy book in Latin, and uses the paper as bedding. Wealth has accumulated from the corpses eaten (Monstrous III):

- 500sp in contemporary coins.
- The heavy leather covers of a Latin holy text. Worth 50sp to a bookbinder.
- Several suits of fine silks and furs - worth 400sp if repairs and cleaned.
- _Fairypenny_ (&T)
- A vial of lethal poison.
- _Library Flagstone_ (&T)

\newpage

### 03.09 Donenashoe

The forests in this hex have swathes of damage through them, forming bands of growth. Swollen herds of deer eat the many fresh shoots.

This crumbling ruined city is haunted by Llamon, a Juggernaut. She has four legs of ridged stone, and a body of thick, shaggy fur twined with a parasitic bramble. Small, weak eyes have a dull orange glow. If intruders are spotted entering Donenashoe, she will clumsily pursue, further devastating the ruins. She will pursue as far as adjacent hexes before slowly returning. If the belly of Llamon is split open, her guts tumble out and she dies.

The remaining buildings are made of stone, quarried in eastern Albann and carved to a style from over the seas. Within squat 198 Goblins. They covet man-made goods - wearing scraps of fabric as status symbols.

Each Turn, there is a 2-in-6 chance of encountering 4d6 Goblins. Roll reaction each time, unless Goblin corpses are present. 

For each Turn spent searching, 3d6sp in coins and baubles can be found by searching the buildings. 

The centre of the city is dominated by a Temple. Moving towards it, the streets begin to fill with perfect marble statues of Goblins. It takes 30 minutes to reach from the edge of the city. The Temple is structurally sound, but has been heavily defaced. Statues of human warriors cluster around it, faces full of fear. It contains a Medusa. The wealth inside is undisturbed (Monstrous III):

- 1000sp in mixed coins - many of heavy gold, stamped with centuries-dead emperors.
- 5 delicate bottles of pungent religious perfume, worth 500sp.
- A back-back full of religious icons in silver and gold - depicting eagles, bulls, wolves, cities build atop corpses, winged figures pulling up unfortunate sinners. Worth 600sp.
- A single draft of _The Sculptors Medium._ (&T)

### 05.09 Belcarra 

Stilt-houses rise from the fog of the moor. Fires are scant amongst the 99 inhabitants. Their lives are spent in quiet service to the Druid-Cult. Ecstatic rituals can be heard at night, deadened by the fog. All are expected to fight if needed. Those who won't are used as practice for the rest - the Druids remember the previous occupation, and will never allow it to happen again. 

A large, unlit pyre stands in the middle of the village. It would burn 30ft high, and be visible for miles. 

All are painted in swirling patterns of blue. They will not speak to outsiders. They only point to the South if questioned. If pressed, they begin threatening with their weapons, and light the immense signal fire to warn the Druids.

80 fanatical footmen.

\newpage

### 06.09 Bitter Druid

The sea wind bites with teeth here. It is desolate - few trees are to be seen, only the sharp undulation of the terrain and the rocks emerging like bones from wounds. Within such a crease, charms of bone may be found. These were taken from long-retreated conquerors, and mark the lair of a Druid. 

They have abandoned language, and shepherd the people of Cloyne. They are centuries old - the same Druid who was cast out from Culemwardern when a Brythonic conqueror took it. Resentment burns within eyes more animal than man. They are clad only in discarded feathers and blood.  
They know the spell _Invisibility_ and may cast it once a day. This spell does not affect the sight of domesticated animals. They use this to harass and ambush intruders and threats. Those taking maximum damage (or Surprised) have a triple-gouge symbol clawed into their forehead - this marks them as an enemy of the Druid-Cult. This heals into an obvious scar.

There is a 30% chance they are here - otherwise returning on a 4-in-6 per Turn spent exploring.

Within their lair, buried beneath accumulated shit, is wealth from a previous life (Temple I):

- 400sp in golden coins, marked in Ghom.
- Sacrificial Knife of meteoric iron worth 150sp.
- _Falcon Hood._ (&T)

### 01.10 Dorbog 

The boundless western sea pummels Dorbog, home to 800. It shows clear signs of Norse influence, long wooden houses jostling with Ruis drystone architecture. Above both towers a fortress built in a style imported from the south, long ago. The fingers of captive kings were crushed in it's construction.  
From this fortress rules Donnagh (HD 5, Maille, Shield, Mace), freshly ascended after his uncle died childless two years ago. A Druid, Mish (Cure Light, Moderate Wounds), is always by his side. Donnagh acts to force peace upon the isle - promising both Cioran and Glas to side against them if they seek war.

The people of Dorbog are diseased. None know it, but the river that runs through the town is polluted. Dead livestock and wildlife can be found all along it. Mish is willing to offer the healing arts of the Druid-Cult for one who resolved this issue. Those already marked for death by the cult could find forgiveness in such an act. 

On the outskirts of Dorbog is a faceless man. His name has been forgotten. He has sold everything to pay for someone to recover his face from the dog that stole it and fled to the North. - a sign in Latin outside his house explains this, promising 1000sp. This bounty has long since been stolen. He is not aware. 

50 armoured footmen, 50 skirmishers, three Karvi plus eight fishing boats. 

Most of the population speaks passable Norse.

### 03.10 Awoken King

Deep in the forested wetlands, the waters are not still. A Mummy - once a king, sent to beg aid - has arisen with a troop of twelve skeletons, all armed & armoured in bronze (Maille, Swords). The Mummy wields _Eyebiter_ (&T). The band slay animals and leave them in the spring that feeds the river - and so death creeps downstream to Dorbog. They have grave-goods (Tomb III):

- 6 _Doubleface Drachm._ (&T)
- Thirteen heavy bronze necklaces, studded with gems. Worth 1300sp.
- _Ivory Miniature_ (&T)

\newpage

### 05.10 Stone Circle

A huge stone circle crowns a hill, rising atop the crawling shrubs. Movement is constant - there are always 2d4 Druids in straw cloaks and fern coats here, maintaining and guarding. Birds, deer and disheveled humans often approach, bow, shit, and leave. One of the Druids eats this, and then whispers to the others. 

On full moons and before major actions they conduct sacrifices - usually individuals kidnapped from Albann, but Ruislish opposed to their designs are favoured. These are conducted on the stone tables surrounded by the circles. 

The hill is a barrow complex - the Druids study and sleep within it, nestled with the bones of their forebears. The tunnels are tight and claustrophobic. 

If the Stone Circle is attacked, the Druids summon 2d20 wolves from the moor. Rats within the barrow pour forth as three independent 5HD swarms. An Ennt awakens in 1d6 Rounds and joins the fray, begrudgingly. This is the last favour it owe the Druids.

In times of war, the population of Belcarra camp here. 

The Druids have the following spells - read down in order as far as is needed.

1. Fireball
2. Fear
3. Haste/Slow
4. Lightning Bolt
5. Transmute Mud to Rock
6. Weather Control
7. Web
8. Wall of Fire

Searching the barrow takes a full day, but reveals much treasure (Temple III) :

- 4000sp in lost coins.
- A 4000-coin _Coat of Coins_ (&T), taken from an invading general celebrating their previous conquests. Has 5 different currencies used in it's construction.
- Three full bags of uncut gems, worth 1000sp.
- Two blocks of ivory, engraved with symbols of authority - worth 500sp.
- Three full baskets of shells, worth 450sp.
- A _Cloak of Hands._(&T) 
- A _Mummified Dog._(&T) 
- A _Faerie Boat._(&T) 
- A _Potion of Architecture Friendship._(&T) 
- _Red Pouch._(&T) 
- _Egron,_ bound in vines coiled like chains.(&T) 

\newpage

### 06.10 Pirates 

A Karvi is hidden in a deep, narrow cove. 30 Bandits (Light Armour, Swords, Javelins) cook fish over coals, careful to avoid too much smoke. Booty from Albann is heaped around. They are lead by Niamh (5HD, Maille, Battle-Axe, Bow). She challenges superior foes to a duel - giving her crew a chance to escape aboard their ship. If she thinks her crew can win, they simply attack.

The crew hail from all the villages and towns of Ruislip, and speak passable Brythonic and Pictish. 1d20 of them are drunk at any given point. Their unspent haul (Bandits II):

- 300sp in silver Brythonic coins
- A small bone case containing 10 doses of opium, worth 300sp. The case is decorated with a flowing, abstract motif.
- Six silver ingots, each stamped with the profile face of a Pictish king. Worth 300sp.
- Four bags of ornamental flower seeds, worth 320sp. 
- A _God Casket._(&T)
- A pictoral map, marking a small cairn in the interior of an island. Those who have seen it would recognise this isle as Dunrick. At this location, a huge hoard is buried (Bandits III): 
	+ 1000sp in Brythonic, Pictish and Ruislip coins
	+ A large jar, full of black pepper corns. Worth 1000sp 
	+ A hundred swords. Worth 120sp.
	+ Three vats of Greek Fire. Worth 2400sp.
	+ Eight full kegs of pickled vegetables. Worth 500sp.
	+ Twenty wrapped blocks of salt. Worth 2000sp.

\newpage

### 02.11 Ogonnelloe

A ruined fort - nothing but an L of stacked stone - pierces the treeline and marks the location of Ogonnelloe, home to 80. They are trappers of game and hewers of wood. 

The village was lead by Ailín until recently - he has been missing for three days. Before that, Caoimhe disappeared. All are set to fearfully clutching swords as the night creeps through the village. 

For centuries, against the day they are needed again, a Werewolf has dwelt in the village, passing on the curse as they feel time settle against old bones. Before the newest apprentice - Clodagh - could complete her training, the previous Werewolf was killed by his wife - jealous of the time he spent with young Clodagh. As such, she does not know how to control the curse. She was told of others on Albann who share the curse, but no more than that.

The bodies have been devoured. The next attack may not be fatal, and propagate the curse. Both the Druid Cult and the Christians will begin to notice as the bodies stack. 

24 skirmishers. 

### 03.11 Orc Fort

Within the depths of the moor, a fort leans, the wet soil unable to support it. Water pools, rainbow shimmers playing across the surface. During the day, greasy black smoke emerges, coiling into the sky. The fort has a partially collapsed dry-stonewall surrounding it - there are 3 main sections which have collapsed. 

The fort is narrow, and has three floors. 80 Orcs dwell within. During the day they forge their weapons and slugs of iron. At night they roam the surrounding hexes in bands of 16, looking for victims. 30 remain to guard the lumps of meat growing into more Orcs.  

In case of an attack, they blow horns to summon back the war-bands, and use javelins and bows to keep intruders at bay, firing from the upper floors. All have axes, clubs or swords. 20 of them have javelins. A further 20 have bows. A pit for remains also acts as a store of treasure (Monstrous II twice):

- 600sp in mixed coinage - much of it silver and local.
- 5 Tin ingots, worth 225sp.
- 5 bundles of dried Liberty Caps, worth 250sp.
- A single block of pure ivory, worth 200sp.
- A vellum map with instructions in Latin. They describe an otherwise nondescript hill in 06.11. Buried half-way up is a metal box, heavily rusted. Within is (Magic User I):
	+ 300sp in silver dhirrams.
	+ A pouch of cinnamon bark, worth 100sp.
	+ _The Running Net_ (&T)

### 01.12 St Olham's Monastery 

The only monastery on Ruislip, inhabited by 96 monks.  The abbot, Sean, was raised in the Druid-Cult, and despises them with a passion. He is dedicated to rooting out their influence on the politics of Ruislip - to the point of betraying his Christian ideals. The other monks put their entire faith in him - such converts are vanishingly rare. 

All of the monks at least passably speak Latin and Ruis - many of them can read. Sean is able to read Ghom. They have the most complete historical annals, although they are very one-sided - going so far as to praise the ancient invaders who first brought the faith to the island. Some of the more free-spirited monks also collate myths and stories. 

Hospitality is offered to all who do not openly bear pagan symbols - if they are willing to listen to the sermons. 

The monastery contains (Temple II):

- 2000sp in Ruis and Brythonic coins.
- Ten bottles of fine wine from Pyorra, worth 200sp.
- The complete skeleton of St Olham, worth 1500sp to jaded Christian collector or pagan warlord.

### 03.12 A Dog 

A huge wolfhound bathes in the river. If offered food, it will become incredibly loyal although will cheekily steal food whenever inconvenient.

\newpage

### 05.12 Blulach

A thousand souls dwell within the stone walls of Blulach, open only to the channel that separates Ruislip and Albann. Within the walls, stone streets and cramped wooden houses. Brythonic is as common and Ruis in the markets and alehouses. A church looms above most of the buildings, and shows signs of generations of devoted maintenance. 

From a small fort on the docks, Glas (4HD, Maille, Spear, Shield) rules with his loyal men, all clad in maille. His Christian faith and Albann heritage is no secret - his family were imported here by the ancient invaders. They have formed a warrior aristocracy, and consider one-another cousins. Members of the Druid-Cult are burnt alive in the market square if discovered. 

Glas offers a bounty of 750sp for the head of Niamh - she raids his fishing and trade vessels, ensuring that any of his family are killed.

The bishop, Guaire, will pay 1000sp for the removal of the Gargoyles in 04.13. You would not be the first to try.

A paddock of 20 riding horses, liable to snap, eyes rolling, is kept outside the wall. 

20 armoured footmen, 40 footmen, 60 skirmishers, 20 horsemen, 2 Knarr plus 8 fishing boats.

### 06.12 Barrows

As the salt just begins to fade from the air, the Barrows dot the landscape. A ruined camp is nearby - weeks old. Supplies and digging tools have been left. Sustained inspection reveals an excavated entrance to a barrow-mound, covered with cunningly pinned turf.  

In the darkness below, a Wraith lurks, accompanied by 4 Zombies - the thralls earned with the blood of grave-robbers. It will try to avoid combat during the day, unless the Zombies can be positioned to block the exit - then it strikes those bearing light first. 

At night, it emerges and haunts the hex, drawing victims into ambushes with it's Zombie thralls. 

Within each barrow is a Tomb III hoard. Disturbing unopened mounds releases another Wraith. The already opened barrow contains (Tomb III):

- 300sp in old bronze coins.
- Several springs of still-pungent funeral herbs, worth 100sp.
- A _Ships Head,_ taking the form of a spike painted with a hundred eyes. (&T)
- A tub containing a single dose of _The Wax of Refusal._ (&T)

\newpage

### 02.13 Nameless Hamlet 

Above a thin sandy beach, an empty hamlet. No food, no nets, no tools. Furs and clothes have been left to rot. Nothing has stirred here for years - thatched roofs have fallen in. Birds nest in ruins. Shells are abundant within the shells of buildings.  

The sea seems gentle here. Foam forms castles which are dissolved beneath a lead sky.

At night, yellow-blue lights dance beneath the water, a half-mile off the coast. 2d6 Merfolk remember fishing there.

### 04.13 Gargoyles

By the river they cluster, as they have done for decades. 11 Gargoyles, coated in hard-baked mud. Despite new beliefs, people from Blulach still sneak out and throw the water over them. Less people die this way. When Glas has tried to deal with them, too many cousins have died - only two of the Gargoyles died.

They slowly, painfully pivot their heads to watch you. If you bear no buckets, they achingly move to defend themselves. Their pain fuels their violence. 

### 04.14 Killucan

This sparse village of 43 is gathered around a tiny church. They are outnumbered 4-1 by their cattle, and distrust river fish. They are used only as bait for ocean fishing. They always have a bountiful harvest. 

Ultán plans to join the Gargoyles, having announced this publicly a week ago. Everyone knows this is because Ciamhnait spurned his advances. None are motivated to stop him - even his parents do not care. He continues to mope and loudly plan his journey.

Unbeknownst the priest, Killucan was once much larger. Half the village took to the water. The remaining half still feel the call of the sea. Some develop scales and hide them. 

They defer to Glas of Blulach in terms of governance. 

5 footmen, 5 skirmishers, 5 fishing boats.
