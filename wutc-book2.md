## Magic Jar	

_One Use:_ A soul-vessel is prepared, requiring a huge investment in research, blood and treasure. The transferral ritual takes a full month, during which the body must be maintained by others - any lapse in concentration causes failure. This one of the paths a man could walk to leave mortality behind. 

 The soul of the caster is moved to the soul-vessel. The spirit may leave and attempt to animate soulless bodies or vie with other souls for control of their own bodies.

## Project Image	

_1/day:_ The caster murders themselves in a different dimension or space, gaining the ability to invoke this other-self.

 For 18 Turns, all illusions and magical visual alterations do not affect the caster. All hidden objects reveal themselves. The true nature of any magically changed item or creature is obvious.

 Acts as a detached third eye the caster may see through at any distance. It is invisible, and moves through the air at the pace of walking person. It lasts for 6 Turns.

# Warding 

The base Warding save represents an innate protection against ill magics. These are supplemented with the use of protective charms. 

Unless noted otherwise, a character may only benefit from one such charm a day although many may be carried. Uses involving the application of a charm after the fact do not count for this limit. (_Ex: A character may be daubed in the blood of a Bear and
re-roll a save using an unguent of Betony. They would not benefit
from the blood of a bear and wearing a garland of Betony._)

_Plants are only effective for 2 weeks after being picked unless specifically turned to a power or unguent as per the description._

## Cowslip 

Yellow flowers and a stem said to prophecy the seasons. A tea made from the petals protects against ailments natural and otherworldly. +2 Warding vs Disease/Poison magic.

## Dogs 

What has not been said of loyal companions whose senses extend beyond human sight, human hearing and human sensitivity? A ghost-white hound protects the heart, a red dog the mind, and a dog raised in a church the soul. +1 Warding vs Fear effects. +2 Warding vs Mind-Altering effects. +1 Warding. These benefits can be concurrent with other charms, although only one dog may be benefited from. 

## Elecampane 

Bright yellow flowers, open to the world and drinking it in. Those in Albann know it as a sign of elves, and leave it well alone.

Automatic Save once against damage-dealing magical effect - but the sprig is destroyed.

## Hellebore 

Flowers in many colours, none to be trifled with. The black purges the mind and body, explosively. The white numbs pain and distances the imbiber from reality. The green is said to be a cure for sadness, although this is just a cruel joke.  Re-roll Warding vs Mind-Altering effects at +6 - regardless of success, bed-bound with violent diarrhoea. No effect. Physique save or painful death.

## Horseshoes 

A perennial charm of fortune.  +1 Warding. If purchased for this purpose, no effect - they must be found, or stolen.

## Verbena 

The purple flowers of the Verbena, worn in a pocket, distract malign forces.  +3 Warding. After a single successful save, the flower withers and becomes useless. 

## Writing 

The written word, whether latin script or ancient runes, has a magic of its own and can protect against other forms. Markings in common materials give +1 Warding against exactly what they describe. Markings in sea-beast ink and monster-blood taken from a 5HD+ creature grant +2 Warding against a category of threat. Runes in crushed diamond mixed with royal blood may grant +3 Warding forever more, power condensed into a single phrase or marking. Sea-beast ink and monster-blood may be used to create tattoos, which grant +1 Warding permanently. This benefit can be concurrent with other charms. Up to two such tattoos may be worn, but the second must be sourced from a higher HD creature than the first.

## Yarrow 

White and lilac flowers, pounded to a poultice and spread upon the back, are said to instill bravery enough to face down the unworldly.  +6 Warding vs Fear effects. 

## Yew 

Another storied tree, the berries used to avoid capture - the eaters escaping into death. It has authority over the dead, and demands they remain asleep. Shields of yew carry this charm with them. +4 Warding vs effects from the undead beneath a Yew tree. +3 Warding for a yew-shield bearer.
